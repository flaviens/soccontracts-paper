We introduced platform timing contracts as a natural extension of hardware-software contracts to reason about timing channels in full-system contexts rather than isolated CPUs.
To make such reasoning feasible with existing verification frameworks, we proposed an automatic instrumentation that accounts for platform-specific timing effects while preserving compatibility with prior techniques.
Our evaluation shows that this approach incurs minimal verification overhead while uncovering timing channels that would otherwise remain invisible in isolation.
