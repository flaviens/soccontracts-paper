We introduced platform timing contracts as a natural extension of hardware-software contracts to reason about timing channels in full-system contexts rather than isolated CPUs.
To make such reasoning compatible with existing CPU timing side-channel verification frameworks, we proposed an automatic instrumentation that accounts for platform-specific timing effects.
Our evaluation shows that this approach incurs minimal verification overhead while uncovering timing channels that would otherwise remain invisible in isolation.
