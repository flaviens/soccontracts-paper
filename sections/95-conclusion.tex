We introduced platform timing contracts as an extension of hardware-software contracts.
They provide a language for specifying expected timing channels in full-system contexts rather than isolated CPUs.
To make such reasoning compatible with existing CPU timing side-channel verification frameworks, we proposed an instrumentation that accounts for platform-specific timing effects.
Our evaluation shows a negligible verification performance overhead while uncovering timing channels that would otherwise remain invisible in isolation.
