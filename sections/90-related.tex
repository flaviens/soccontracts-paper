Previous work introduced mitigations against cache timing attacks~\cite{kar2023mitigating,saileshwar2021mirage,giner2023scatter,werner2019scattercache,qureshi2018ceaser} or network on chip interference~\cite{wassel2013surfnoc,wang2012efficient,schoeberl2012statically,psarras2015phasenoc,alonso2019low,sadeghi2019toward}.
Our work is orthogonal to these works and models a platform where some channels are tolerated (e.g., cache timing).
Some hardware-software contracts and constant-time techniques~\cite{guarnieri2021hardware,wang2023specification,tan2025contractshadowlogic} typically assume that addresses of memory operations might eventually influence timing.
% But not all platforms will have such flows, and some platforms will also create reentrant timing flows from other CPU output signals as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:reentrant}.
Our instrumentation is also compatible with techniques that require more manual effort~\cite{fastpath}.
In conclusion, the \PICI that we introduce proposes fine-grained platform integration contracts, and makes them synthesizable so that they can directly be used upon techniques that are unaware of reentrant information flows.
