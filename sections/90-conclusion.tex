We presented \ourname, a differential fuzzer that composes LLM-generated short coverage-guided SystemVerilog snippets into complex test cases for EDA software.
By combining semantic parsing and snippet scoring, \ourname overcomes the limitations of both procedural and pure LLM-based fuzzers.
Our approach discovers \numnewbugs previously unknown bugs, including \numnewbugscombi that neither technique alone could expose.
These findings underline the security risks of mistranslation vulnerabilities and demonstrate the promise of integrating LLM-based synthesis with structured fuzzing to strengthen hardware design toolchains.
